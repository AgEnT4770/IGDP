# Project Name:
IGDP (Internet Gaming Database) 

# Project Idea:
A game surfing app that includes game reviews, descriptions, requirements, and where to find and buy the game. 

# Project Plan:
## Week 1 – Project Setup & Core UI :

Goals:
	•	Set up project structure in Android Studio.
	•	Configure Gradle dependencies (Jetpack Compose, Retrofit/OkHttp, Coroutines, Coil/Glide, etc.).
	•	Define app architecture (MVVM or Clean Architecture).
	•	Create mock data to design UI without API.
	•	Build core screens with Compose:
	•	Home Screen (list of games)
	•	Game Details Screen (basic layout)
	•	Navigation setup with Navigation-Compose.

✅ Deliverable: Functional app with navigation and mock UI for game list & details.

## Week 2 – API Integration & Data Layer

Goals:
	•	Connect to the chosen API (RAWG API).
	•	Implement Retrofit for network calls.
	•	Set up data layer (Repositories, DTOs, Models).
	•	Use Coroutines + Flow for async data.
	•	Replace mock data with real API responses.
	•	Implement error handling & loading states.

✅ Deliverable: Game list fetched from API and displayed in the Home Screen.

## Week 3 – Features & State Management

Goals:
	•	Implement search functionality (search games by name).
	•	Add filtering/sorting (e.g., by genre, release date).
	•	Integrate pagination (infinite scroll).
	•	Improve UI with Material3 design.
	•	Apply proper state handling (e.g., using StateFlow or ViewModel).
	•	Cache data with Room (optional, for offline mode).

✅ Deliverable: Searchable, filterable game list with smooth scrolling and polished UI.

## Week 4 – Testing, Polish & Deployment

Goals:
	•	Unit tests for ViewModel & Repository.
	•	UI tests with Compose Testing.
	•	Optimize performance (lazy lists, image loading).
	•	Improve UX (skeleton loaders, error dialogs).
	•	Add splash screen & app icon.
	•	Prepare Play Store-ready build (if needed).

✅ Deliverable: Fully functional, tested, and polished Game Discovery app.
